title: ANNarchy - Artificial Neural Networks architect
---
ANNarchy (Artificial Neural Networks architect) is a neuro-simulator for rate-coded or spiking neural networks in Python.

This tutorial for beginners is a condensed version of the [manual](/manual/index.qmd)  and the associated [Jupyter notebooks](/notebooks/index.qmd). Its intent is to quickly introduce users to ANNarchy so they can start modeling right away. 

The slides of the tutorial are available [here](presentation.qmd){target="_blank"} (or simply press `'f'` in the frame below).
