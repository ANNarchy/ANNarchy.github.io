# Projection

The module `ANNarchy.Projection` defines projections at the population
level. A projection is an ensemble of connections (or synapses) between
a subset of a population (called the pre-synaptic population) and a
subset of another population (the post-synaptic population), with a
specific connection type. The pre- and post-synaptic populations may be
the same.
